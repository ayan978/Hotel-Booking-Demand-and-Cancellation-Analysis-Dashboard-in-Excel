# Hotel Booking Demand and Cancellation Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to uncover patterns in demand, cancellations, and revenue. The data was cleaned and preprocessed in Excel, and an interactive dashboard was developed to summarize insights for non-technical stakeholders.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Hotel Booking Demand Dataset**, which contains **119,390 records** from two hotels (a resort hotel and a city hotel) between **July 2015 and August 2017**.  
The dataset includes **32 variables** such as booking dates, length of stay, number of guests, country of origin, distribution channel, deposit type, average daily rate (ADR), and booking status (canceled or not).
